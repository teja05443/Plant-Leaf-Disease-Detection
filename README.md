# Plant Leaf Disease Detection using AWS Rekognition

This project demonstrates how to use AWS Rekognition Custom Labels for detecting plant leaf diseases. The model is trained using a dataset of 5000+ images from Roboflow and is integrated with a Python application leveraging the Boto3 library and AWS Cloud9.

## Features
- **Start the Model**: Start the AWS Rekognition Custom Labels model for inference.
- **Detect Disease**: Detect plant leaf diseases by analyzing images stored in an S3 bucket.
- **Stop the Model**: Stop the AWS Rekognition model to save resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **AWS Account**: Set up AWS credentials with permissions for Rekognition, S3, etc.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python.
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library for image processing.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-leaf-disease-detection.git
   cd plant-leaf-disease-detection

2. **Install Dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Set Up AWS Credentials**

4. **Acknowledgments**
Thanks to Roboflow for the dataset.
AWS Rekognition for providing powerful image recognition capabilities.
